## Overview

This framework is intended to be a thin / lightweight library which provides some core MVC features for building applications with WordPress. You will most likely not interact with this package directly, instead please use the [WPMVC Example](https://github.com/TheCodeCompany/wpmvc-example) repository which provides the basis for an mu-plugin using WPMVC as a dependency.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.1+
- WordPress 6.4+

## Roadmap
- Dependency injection
- Use of traits for REST, routing etc.
- Scaffolding and other useful CLI tooling.
- Better documentation.
